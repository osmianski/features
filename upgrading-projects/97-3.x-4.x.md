## Shorter Layer Syntax

Since `4.0`, you can refer to any scalar or array property in the layer rule selector. Scalar property values are replaced, array property values are merged:

    '#page.modifier' => '-home',

Previously, layer rule selector could only reference `View` object, so you had to be more verbose:

    '#page' => [
        'modifier' => '-home',
    ],

It is not a breaking change, but we recommended reviewing your layer files and using the new syntax.

## New Page View Structure

Since `4.0`, `#page` view doesn't have `header`, `content` and `footer` properties. Instead, it is a `Container` (as specified in `f2`) laying out its child views vertically according to their `sort_order` properties and adding a wrap around it. 

`base` layer add `#content` view which also a vertical container:

    return [
        'root' => Page::new([
            'id' => 'page',
            ...
            'views' => [
                'content' => Container::new([
                    'id' => 'content',
                    ...
                    'sort_order' => 100,
                ]),
            ],
        ]),
    ];

It is a breaking change requiring to review all layer files: 

1. Replace assignment to the `content` property with `#content` selector.

    Old code:
    
        '#page' => [
            'content' => Container::new([
                'id' => 'content',
                'id_' => null,
                'modifier' => 'page-section',
                'views' => [            
                    'breadcrumbs' => Breadcrumbs::new([...]),
                    'heading' => Heading::new([...]),
                    'form' => Form::new([...]),
                ],
            ]),
        ],
    
    New code:  

        '#content.views' => [
            'breadcrumbs' => Breadcrumbs::new([...]),
            'heading' => Heading::new([...]),
            'form' => Form::new([...]),
        ],

2. Replace assignment to the `header` or `footer` property with adding to `#page.views`. Use `sort_order` property to position header and footer above and below the content.

    Old code:
    
        '#page' => [
            'header' => Header::new([
                'id' => 'header',
                'modifier' => 'page-section -secondary',
            ]),
        ],

    New code:
    
        '#page.views' => [
            'header' => Header::new([
                'id' => 'header',
                'wrap_modifier' => '-secondary',
                'sort_order' => 10,
            ]),
        ],

3. Remove wrapper HTML elements from the child view Blade templates. Use `wrap_modifier` property to add CSS modifier to wrap element. 

    Old code:
    
        <header class="page-section {{ $view->modifier }}">
            @include ($view->menu)
        </header>

    New code (`<header>` is not a wrap anymore but rendered inside a wrap):
                
        <header>
            @include ($view->menu)
        </header>

## New `empty` View Property

Since `4.0`, views should set their `empty` property to `true` if they don't render any content. 

Add calculation to the `default()` method of all views which may be empty.
